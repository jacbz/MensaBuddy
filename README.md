## Inspiration
There are many reasons why people eat alone. Maybe they prefer the solitude. Maybe they have a lecture at odd times that no friend of theirs is taking. Maybe they are new to TUM and don't have many people to eat lunch with yet.

For the latter reasons, wouldn't it be nice to bring people together at the lunch table? The casual and relaxed setting is great for building relationships of whatever kind without any obligations.

## What it does
With this app, it is easy to find someone to eat with (a MensaBuddy!). Simply select a Mensa, enter a time interval in which you'd like to have lunch in (eg. 1-2 pm), and a minimum duration for the meal (e.g. 30 minutes).

Then, the app matches you with another user of the app, with whom you have an overlapping time interval with. To improve the quality of matches, we developed a set of psychological questions everyone answers, and a intelligent matching algorithm that takes a bunch of factors into account.

Very importantly, the matching is totally anonymous. You don't need to sign up, you just download the app and jump right in. Nobody will know anything about their MensaBuddy until they actually meet. We see this as an analogy to sitting next to someone randomly and getting into a conversation them.

After lunch, users can decide in the app if they would like to exchange contact information. Only if both agree, they can send a message to each other.
